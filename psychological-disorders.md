  <ol>
    <li>
      They tend to be smart, with a mean IQ of &#8220;bright normal.&#8221;
    </li>
    <li>
      Despite their intelligence, they do poorly in school, have spotty employment records, and generally end up as unskilled workers.
    </li>
    <li>
      They come from deeply troubled families. Typically, they have been abandoned at an early age by their fathers and grow up in broken homes dominated by their mothers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is a long history of psychiatric problems, criminal behavior, and alcoholism in their families.
    </li>
    <li>
      As children, they suffer significant abuse-sometimes psychological, sometimes physical, often sexual. Such brutal mistreatment instills them with profound feelings of humiliation and helplessness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because of their resentment toward their distant, absent, or abusive fathers, they have a great deal of trouble with male authority figures. Because they were dominated by their mothers, they have a powerful hostility toward women.
    </li>
    <li>
      They manifest psychiatric problems at an early age and often spend time in institutions as children.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because of their extreme social isolation and a general hatred of the world and everyone in it (including themselves), they often feel suicidal as teenagers.
    </li>
    <li>
      They display a precocious and abiding interest in deviant sexuality and are obsessed with fetishism, voyeurism, and violent pornography.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    There are three more important characteristics-behavioral red flags-often referred to as psychopathological traid. And those are:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Bed-Wetting &#8211; enuresis</strong></p> <p>
        There&#8217;s nothing unusual or alarming about bed-wetting in itself; it&#8217;s a common phenomenon among little children. When the problem persists into puberty, however, it may well be a sign of significant and even dangerous emotional disturbance. According to the findings of the FBI&#8217;s Behavioral Science Unit, fully 60 percent of sex-murderers were still suffering from this condition as adolescents-like the African-American serial killer Alton Coleman, who wet his pants so often that he was saddled with the taunting nickname &#8220;Pissy.&#8221;
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Fire-Starting &#8211; pyromania</strong> <p>
        Given their lust for destruction, it&#8217;s no surprise that, among their other twisted pleasures, many serial killers love to set fires, a practice they often begin at an early age. Some of the most notorious serial killers of modern times were juvenile arsonists. Ottis Toole, for example-Henry Lee Lucas&#8217;s loathsome accomplice-began torching vacant houses when he was six years old. Carl Panzram -arguably the most unrepentant killer in the annals of American crime-took positive pride in the havoc he could wreak with a matchstick, boasting in his jailhouse memoirs that, at the tender age of twelve, he caused $100,000 worth of damage by burning down a building at reform school. Carlton Gary firebombed a grocery store while still in his teens. And David Berkowitz-who ultimately confessed to more than fourteen hundred acts of arson-was so obsessed with fires as a little boy that his schoolmates nicknamed him &#8220;Pyro.&#8221;
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Animal Torture &#8211; precocious sadism</strong> <p>
        Juvenile sadism directed at lower life-forms is nothing new. There have always been children and adolescents (usually male) who enjoy hurting small creatures. Certainly Shakespeare knew about such things. InKing Lear, he writes about &#8220;wanton boys&#8221; who pull the wings off of flies for &#8220;sport.&#8221; And in Mark Twain&#8217;sAdventures of Huckleberry Finn, the hero finds himself in a one-horse town where a bunch of young loafers are amusing themselves by tying a tin pan to the tail of a stray dog and watching him &#8220;run himself to death.&#8221;
