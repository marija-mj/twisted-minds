  <strong>&#8220;Son of Sam&#8221; serial killer David Berkowitz (58), who murdered six people in the 1970s, will once again not seek to be released from prison, repeating what he has previously said five times since 2002, saying he has &#8220;no interest&#8221; in parole because Jesus has already made him a &#8220;free man.&#8221;</strong>
</p>

Since pleading guilty at his 1978 trial, for killing six women and shooting seven others, the convicted gunman has been serving six consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences at the maximum-security Sullivan Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He was first imprisoned at the Attica Correctional Facility and has served a total of 34 years. He has been up for parole every two years since 2002.

In a [two-page letter](http://www.foxnews.com/interactive/berkowitz/us/2011/08/24/ "read the letter on Fox News"){.broken_link} sent to Fox News he wrote: _â€œI have no interest in parole and no plans to seek release. If you could understand this, I am already a &#8216;free man.&#8217; I am not saying this jokingly. I really am. Jesus Christ has already pardoned me, and I believe this.&#8221;_

Berkowitz writes in his letter to the reporter that he is active in prison ministry, including helping with Sunday services and Bible studies. Although Berkowitz does not have access to a computer, in a website reportedly hosted by a church group at AriseandShine.org, his personal testimony page states that in 1987 he fell to his knees and cried out to Jesus. _&#8220;I told Him that I was sick and tired of doing evil. I asked Jesus to forgive me for all my sins. I spent a good while on my knees praying to Him. When I got up it felt as if a very heavy but invisible chain that had been around me for so many years was broken. A peace flooded over me. I did not understand what was happening. But in my heart I just knew that my life, somehow, was going to be different.&#8221;_ 

&#8220;Son of Sam&#8221; remains one of the most famous born-again convicted murderers in the country, but when he was caught, he says it was the Devil, not God, that informed his actions._&#8220;Sam told me to kill. Sam is the Devil.&#8221;_
