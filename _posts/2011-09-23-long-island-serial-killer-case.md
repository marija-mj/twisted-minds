  <strong>Police are getting an increased number of tips since they released sketches of two, out of five unidentified victims dumped on a Long Island beach by at least one serial killer, including a man dressed as a woman and a woman who may have worked as a prostitute.</strong>
</p>

Police have discovered the body parts of at least 10 people along Ocean Parkway since last December, at least four of whom are believed to be victims of a serial killer.

This week police released composite sketches of two yet unidentified people, also believed to be victims of the serial murderer. The composite sketches depict a woman with long hair and an Asian man. Although only their bones were found, a forensic artist used the victims&#8217; bone structure to recreate their faces.

The woman, dubbed Jane Doe No. 6, was approximately 5-foot-2 and was from 18- to 35-years-old when she died. The male was between the ages of 17 and 23 and stood about 5-foot-6. He was missing one of his top front teeth and two molars, and authorities reveal he was dressed as a woman when he died. Police believe both individuals met their demise about a decade ago.

A police spokeswoman said 22 tips have been received as of Thursday since investigators released sketches of two of five victims who remain unidentified. They also released photos of jewelry found on a female toddler found near Cedar Beach and the partial remains of a woman now believed to be her relative discovered seven miles away near Jones Beach State Park.
