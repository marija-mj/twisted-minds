<p class="dropcap-first">
  Hello and welcome to my page. This time I am just going to make a small introduction so you can enjoy your stay even more. As you can see, this website is about serial killers and psychological disorders of modern world. I will be updating regularly (at least once a week) with fresh case files, and shocking stories about murder and psychopaths.<br /> As it&#8217;s getting quite late over here, and I really need my sleep, I am going to continue working on twistedminds tomorrow. However, even now, everything is functioning, so you&#8217;re more than welcome to browse away!
</p>

I suggest you read my [welcome](/about/welcome-page/ "welcome") page before going any further.

Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your stay.
