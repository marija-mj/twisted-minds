He was sentenced again to life without parole for 25 years. He was serving time for six previous murders, although he once admitted to killing 16 people across North America since his deadly rampage began in 1985.

> The only thing that I regret is that it ended, he told a reporter last year from a prison cell in New Brunswick.

McGray told police after his arrest that Phillips wanted to stage a hostage-taking in which he would be tied up so that he could go to the prison infirmary and McGray could go back to Kent prison. But McGray said he became angry with Phillips and decided to end his “bullshit” and kill him. With a razor and nail clippers, McGray told police he cut up bedsheets to tie up Phillips. He said he strangled him for five minutes, and then punched him in the head to make sure he wasn’t faking death.

The Correctional Service of Canada has never explained why McGray was transferred from the Kent maximum-security prison to the medium-security Mountain Institution. The killes also said during an interview with the National Post a decade ago that he could kill again, even while in prison.

> Just because I’m locked up in segregation doesn’t mean I can’t kill somebody, I have a chance every day.
