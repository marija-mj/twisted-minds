  <strong>Tony Williams has uncovered a six-inch blade amongst the possessions of his distant relative Sir John Williams, which he believes was the one used by Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper &#8211; the name given to an unidentified serial killer who terrorized the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. </strong>

Sir John was recorded to have had performed an abortion on one of the Ripper’s victims.&#8221;_

Williams was the surgeon to Queen Victoria and lived in London at the time of the slayings. He was known to his family at the time of the killings as &#8220;Uncle Jack.&#8221; He left the capital after the murders and went on to establish the National Library for Wales in Aberystwyth.

Tony Williams(49), Sir John’s great-great-great-great nephew, believes the blade he discovered also fits the description of the one used in the attacks. He said: _&#8220;A pathologist at the time said the ripper had used the same six-inch knife in all the murders. He said it would have been at least six inches long, very sharp, pointed at the top and about an inch in width &#8211; a surgeon&#8217;s knife. I am convinced that this is the knife used by Sir John Williams to murder those women.&#8221;_

He has published a book, that features the image of the blade, to expose his uncle&#8217;s guilt &#8211; _&#8220;A lot of members of our family don&#8217;t really speak about it &#8211; I think they are a bit upset. But in my mind the case has been solved &#8211; it was Sir John Williams.&#8221;_
