  <strong>A local television station in Sacramento has received a second letter from convicted serial killer Wesley Shermantine, one of the so-called &#8220;<em>Speed Freak Killers</em>&#8220;, in which he claims he knows of more than 70 murder victims.</strong>

Shermantine was convicted of four murders and sentenced to death. Herzog was convicted of three murders and sentenced to 77 years to life in prison although that was later reduced to 14 years. Herzog was paroled in 2010 and committed suicide last month after Sacramento bounty hunter Leonard Padilla told him Shermantine planned to reveal the burial locations.

Maps that Shermantine had previously provided led authorities to at least three locations, with Shermatine claiming that 10 bodies or more could have been stashed in the area. Investigators found remains belonging to two of Shermantine&#8217;s victims in Calaveras County. They also found hundreds of bone fragments in a well in an abandoned ranch in San Joaquin County. In his second letter, Shermantine reveals no new locations, but states that Herzog told him about &#8220;multiple, 24 X 3&#8221; victims. He also hints that he has even more shocking revelations.

In a letter to CBS Sacramento reporter Koula Gianulias, Shermantine said thus far he has not received any money from Padilla even though he was promissed $33,000 for reveiling the location of the bodies.

> &#8220;I really want to believe in Leonard, but I have these doubts he&#8217;ll come through, which is a shame because I&#8217;ve been holding the best for last,&#8221; Shermantine wrote.
