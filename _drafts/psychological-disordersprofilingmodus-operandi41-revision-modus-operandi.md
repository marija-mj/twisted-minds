    <h4>
      Serial Killers &#8211; Modus Operandi, The Way They Work
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Like everyone else, a killer learns from experience. If you don&#8217;t catch him right away, he&#8217;ll begin to develop his modus operandi, or MO, and probably get better at the crime.<br /> Maybe he&#8217;ll find a more efficient way to kill someone or a quicker way to abduct a woman from a car. He&#8217;ll start showing more control over the crime.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The MO is basically the way the predator commits the crime &#8212; if he uses a gun rather than a knife or lures prospective victims by putting his arm in a fake sling.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While the MO tells us something about how he did it, the signature gives us some insight into why.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Unique to the person
    </h5>
    
    <p>
      The signature is a ritual, something the subject does intentionally for emotional satisfaction &#8212; something that isn&#8217;t necessary to perpetuate the crime. Evidence of torture is a signature. Posing &#8212; displaying the victims in a certain way &#8212; is a signature. Signature is a way of linking cases.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Like a real signature, it&#8217;s a personal detail that&#8217;s unique to the individual.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Sometimes there&#8217;s a fine line between an MO and a signature
    </h5>
    
    <p>
      I&#8217;ve found that signature is a more reliable guide to the behavior of serial offenders than an MO. That&#8217;s because the MO evolves, while the emotional reasoning that triggers the signature doesn&#8217;t. The method a killer uses to get women into his van may change, but the fact that he always tortures them once they&#8217;re inside stays the same.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One subject covered the faces of his victims. That was his signature. So you look for that in other cases in order to tie them together. A bomber used to spray black paint over the components inside his bombs. It wasn&#8217;t necessary &#8212; it didn&#8217;t make the bombs any better. I don&#8217;t know what it meant, but he did it anyway. He felt the need to do it.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Scripting a rape victim
    </h5>
    
    <p>
      In a rape case, a signature could be the language the rapist uses in scripting the victim &#8212; getting her to say what he wants her to say. It&#8217;s something the rapist needs. He doesn&#8217;t need it for the sex act, he needs it for himself.<br /> Sometimes just the way a rapist wants his victims to react becomes his signature. Take the power-reassurance rapist. It&#8217;s just like the name implies. Once he gains control over the victim, he&#8217;s constantly asking for reassurance about his performance. You know, &#8220;Is this good for you? How do I stack up against your husband, your boyfriend?&#8221; He needs her to respond in a certain way.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Unfortunately, you often need more than one case to determine what the signature is. You don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a pattern by looking at a single case.
