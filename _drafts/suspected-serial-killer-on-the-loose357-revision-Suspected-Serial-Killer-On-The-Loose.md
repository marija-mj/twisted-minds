  <strong>CLEVELAND, Ohio &#8211; Scores of law enforcement officers continued their search for convicted 50 years old sex offender Anthony Sowell, while investigators temporarily ended their work at Sowell&#8217;s home after finding the body remains of as many as six people inside and outside his house.</strong>

When police arrived at the home on Thursday with a search warrant, they found two bodies on the third floor. Because the bodies were in advanced stages of decomposition, the bodies have not yet been identified and their genders not yet determined. Friday afternoon a third body was uncovered in a shallow grave in the basement of the home. Cadaver dogs uncovered additional shallow graves in the home&#8217;s backyard. Investigators say they plan to continue searching the home for more evidence. At least two of the bodies were women. One body was found in the back yard, the rest in the house.

_&#8220;Sowell is the most wanted man in Cleveland right now,_&#8221; said police spokesman Lt. Thomas Stacho. He also said that the bodies &#8220;_appear to be in different stages of decomposition._&#8221; He said an expert from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History was at the house helping coroner employees determine when and how the victims had died &#8211; at least one of the victims died from violence.

A review of police reports and court records show Sowell struck up conversations with women, usually by offering them alcohol. Once inside his home, three women said, Sowell choked them, stripped off their clothes and raped them. A fourth woman told police Sowell offered her a beer and choked her, but she was able to run away before he could sexually assault her

Sowell remains at large and on the run. Crime Stoppers and U.S. marshals are offering a $12,000 reward for any information leading to Sowell&#8217;s arrest. He is considered to be extremely dangerous. He is 6 feet tall and 155 pounds. He wears eyeglasses and frequently sports a mustache. He does not drive a car, and is known to collect and cash in scrap metal. He spent 15 years in prison for a rape dating back to 1989.
