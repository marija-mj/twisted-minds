He has been charged as an adult with killing his brother. Conley described the way he murdered him and said he dragged his brother&#8217;s body to his car before driving to see his girlfriend, who told investigators the teen &#8220;seemed happy, more happy than she had seen him in a while. According to the investigators, after killing his brother, Andrew wrapped his head in plastic, tied it with electrical tape and put the body in his trunk. After visiting his girlfriend to give her a sweetheart ring he dumped the body near a park in his town of Rising Sun, about 90 miles (145 kilometres) southeast of Indianapolis.

The teen told investigators he had had fantasies about killing someone since he was in eighth grade, including cutting somebody&#8217;s throat, and felt &#8220;just like&#8221; the serial killer Dexter on the Showtime television series of the same name. &#8220;_Like I had to &#8230; like when people have something like they are hungry and there is a hamburger sitting there and they knew they had to have it and I was sitting there and it just happened_,&#8221; Conley said.

Andrew also told police he did not carry out his fantasy to kill his father, because he was asleep when he went to his bedside with a knife&#8230;twice in one night. _&#8220;You want them to be faced with fear, react to pain, struggle. You want to demonstrate power. I hate to sound like this, the game isn&#8217;t on unless the victim is awake_.&#8221; Dr Daum, a criminal psychologist said serial killers don&#8217;t have emotional attachments, and have to do something extreme to feel anything. Andrew cut himself. &#8220;_For him, excited to watch blood, feel pain of cut. It was extremely stimulating for him, for us it would be a disturbing thing.&#8221;_ He also said if he had not turned himself in, he probably would have killed again. 

County Prosecutor Negangard said he will consider seeking the maximum prison term of life without parole. Conley&#8217;s age makes him ineligible for the death penalty.
