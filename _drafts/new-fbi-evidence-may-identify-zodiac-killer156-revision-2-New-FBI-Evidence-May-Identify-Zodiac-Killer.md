  The DNA results of some possible Zodiac Killer&#8217;s items may finally solve the mystery of the identity of the serial killer who terrorized Northern California&#8217;s Bay Area in the 1960s and 1970s.<br /> The evidence was given to the FBI by Dennis Kaufman, a man who claims that Zodiac Killer&#8217;s name is Jack Tarrance and that he is his stepfather. He also claims that he can prove that: &#8220;<em>He looked liked a family man with three children. He blended in</em>,&#8221; Dennis Kaufman says.

Dennis Kaufmann spent eight years building a circumstantial case against his stepfather he claims even accounts for Zodiac&#8217;s disappearance. He also claims his stepfather Jack Tarrance who died in 2006, in a taped phone conversation, indirectly admitted being the zodiac killer. While going through his belongings, Dennis claims that there was disturbing findings including a knife still covered with what could possibly be dried blood.

Among the incriminating evidence he has also found a black hood with the zodiac sign on it similar to the hood worn during the vicious 1968 Lake Berryessa attack, which is the possible key evidence connecting his stepfather to the killings. Dennis also said Tarrance&#8217;s handwriting matches the Zodiac Killer&#8217;s, and a composite sketch of the killer is strikingly similar to Tarrance.

The FBI confirmed they are running DNA tests on items that Dennis gave them&#8230; Could Jack Tarrance really be the famous Zodiac Killer or is all this just a product of Dennis&#8217; imagination? Will the hood and new evidence reveal the mysterious identity of the man that terrorized Northern California&#8217;s Bay Area for the whole decade? Before jumping to any conclusions I guess we should just wait for the laboratory results.
