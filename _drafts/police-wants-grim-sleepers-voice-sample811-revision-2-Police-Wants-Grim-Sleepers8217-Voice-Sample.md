  <strong>Authorities on Monday requested permission to allow police detectives to take a voice sample of the man accused of being the Grim Sleeper serial killer for comparison with voice recordings from an anonymous male caller who had reported at least two of the killings to 911 operators.</strong>

Lonnie David Franklin Jr., 58, a retired sanitation worker and mechanic accused of being a serial killer dubbed the &#8220;Grim Sleeper&#8221;, was indicted in March on 10 counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Franklin, 57, was arrested in July 2010 at his South L.A. home and charged with murder in the slayings of Ware as well as of Debra Jackson, 29; Henrietta Wright, 35; Bernita Sparks, age unknown; Mary Lowe, 26; Lachrica Jefferson, 22; Alicia Alexander, 18; Princess Berthomieux, 15; Valerie McCorvey, 35; and Janecia Peters, 25. Franklin, who has pleaded not guilty, is also charged with one count of attempted murder, apparently stemming from the assault, the only Grim Sleeper victim that police said is known to have survived. Franklin was initially suspected after police took a DNA sample from his son in an unrelated case and found that it closely resembled DNA evidence recovered in the &#8220;Grim Sleeper&#8221; murders. 

Police believe he may have reported one of his own murders to police. &#8220;_Obviously, we want to compare his voice, so we think he is the caller_,&#8221; said Det. Dennis Kilcoyne. One of the calls that was preserved was a man reporting criminal activity in an alley where victim Barbara Ware, 23, was found shot to death Jan. 10, 1987. Authorities say they have at least one other voice recording but declined to discuss the case, saying it involved a crime that Franklin had not been charged with. 

Police say serial killers sometimes report their own crimes so they can hide near the murder scene and watch the commotion.
