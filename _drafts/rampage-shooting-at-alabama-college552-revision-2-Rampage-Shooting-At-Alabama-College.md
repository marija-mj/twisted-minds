  <strong>Dr Amy Bishop Anderson, now 42, a biology professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, is accused of fatally shooting three colleagues and injuring three others at a faculty meeting on Friday. Police Department recalled that Amy Bishop had murdered her 18 year old brother, Seth back in 1986, but it was ruled out as an &#8220;accident&#8221;.</strong>

The 40-year-old, Harvard-educated geneticist and her husband, Jim Anderson, are credited with inventing a mobile cell incubation system touted as a replacement for the old-fashioned petri dish: _&#8220;She was just really passionate about what she was doing, and very energetic,&#8221;_ Stuart Obermann, a former board member of the BizTech technology incubator, said of Bishop. _&#8220;I&#8217;m really quite shocked.&#8221;_

Three biology faculty members were shot to death in a third floor conference room and three others were wounded, when Anderson began shooting for no apparent reason. Huntsville police spokesman Sgt. Mark Roberts said Bishop was charged Saturday morning with one count of capital murder. She was taken Friday night in handcuffs from a police precinct to the county jail and could be heard telling TV reporters, _&#8220;It didn&#8217;t happen. There&#8217;s no way &#8230;. they are still alive.&#8221;_

<img class="left" title="news coverage in the murder of Amy's brother" src="img/post/news-coverage.jpg" alt="photo of news coverage of Amy killing her brother Seith" /> Nearly 25 years ago she &#8220;accidentally&#8221; killed her 18 years old brother. By her account, Amy decided at this time &#8220;_that it would be a good idea if she learned how to load the shotgun in the house._&#8221; She suggested she had been concerned about her safety due to a break-in the year before. _&#8220;Amy said that she was carrying the gun pointed beside her leg and that Seth told her to point the gun up,&#8221;_ the report says. _&#8220;Amy had the gun in one hand and started to raise it. Amy further states that someone said something to her and she turned and the gun went off.&#8221;_ That being the second time a weapon that fires only when the trigger is pulled just &#8220;went off.&#8221; The report declared the shooting accidental _&#8220;due to the testimony of the members of the Bishop family.&#8221;_ The case was closed.

Now a cover up is being investigated, because the police records have turned up missing in the Bishop murder case. The former police chief denies any cover up and doesn&#8217;t know why the case would go missing.

Also, back in 1993 Dr. Amy Bishop Anderson was accused of mailing a bomb to a professor that she was angry with. So loved ones of the victims are now left wondering why Professor Amy Bishop Anderson was even hired by UAH because of her criminal background even if she was not charged in the cases. She was obviously unstable, but it took three lives, maybe even four if we include her brother, to finally arrest her.
