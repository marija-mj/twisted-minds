  <strong>Serial Killer Rodney Alcala was convicted of five serial slayings, for the third time, after being sentenced to death twice for killing the Orange County girl, but both convictions were overturned. He is also suspected in up to 30 more deaths.</strong>

A jury convicted Rodney Alcala, 66 years old amateur photographer, Thursday of murdering a 12-year-old girl and four women in the late 1970s, setting the stage for a possible death penalty in a legal saga that has dragged on 30 years. Jurors took less than two days to reach guilty verdicts against Rodney Alcala after six weeks of testimony. The penalty phase of the case begins Tuesday.

Police believe Alcala, who has been in custody since 1979 and has twice had previous convictions overturned, could be responsible for dozens more deaths in New York and Los Angeles in the 70s, and some even say he is a new Ted Bundy. Authorities said they were able to tie Alcala to the murder of four Los Angeles County women between 1977 and 1979. Investigators said they linked Alcala to the torture and murder of Jill Barcomb, 18; Georgia Wixted, 27; Charlotte Lamb, 32; and Jill Parenteau, 21, with DNA, blood and fingerprint evidence. Each murder carried a special circumstance charge that would make Alcala subject to the death penalty.

The Samsoe case, which was first tried in 1980, presented more of a challenge for prosecutors because it was built largely on circumstantial evidence. Murphy said he does not expect this third conviction to be overturned:  
_&#8220;This one is as clean as we can possibly make it for an appeal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a good jury and we feel very satisfied with the progress of the case so far.&#8221;_
