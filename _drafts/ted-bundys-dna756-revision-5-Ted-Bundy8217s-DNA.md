  <strong>Ted Bundy, one of the most infamous serial killers in history, noted for his intelligence and evil nature, has emerged again as a suspect in a murder. In 1961, 8 year old Ann Marie Burr was abducted and killed, and now the cold case detectives hope that DNA from Bundy will solve this case.</strong>

  <em>&#8220;Ted Bundy was one of the biggest serial murderers in this state&#8217;s history,&#8221;</em> Keith Kameg, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said Friday in a telephone interview. <em>&#8220;He often boasted that he had killed 30 people but there always a belief that was low.&#8221;</em> He enjoyed the spotlight, and actually defended himself at trial. He was charismatic and that helped his cause, as he played victim, sporting crutches or a sling to lure a young female to his vehicle under the pretense to help him out. He took advantage and murdered many women, escaped from prison, and did it again, while professing his innocence the whole time.

  Executed in January 1989, Bundy was linked to brutal murders in at least six states before he was captured in Florida after daring escapes elsewhere. He received three death sentences in two separate trials for three known Florida murders, perhaps the most famous of which was that of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach.

  Bundy’s DNA profile was obtained recently from a blood sample he had given at one time in Florida. On Friday, his DNA was uploaded into a national database in the hope that the new material will help solve murder cases that have gone cold over the years. It was uploaded to the national Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, database, where it will be stored with 10 million profiles from other felons.

  <em>&#8220;As technology gets better, there is a larger possibility that some cold cases could be solved,&#8221;</em> Kameg said.<em> &#8220;People want closure and law enforcement can provide that.&#8221;</em>
