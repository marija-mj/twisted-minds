  <strong>The 1974 disappearance and slaying of a 13 year old Georgia girl has been solved. DNA and other clues linked this case to a long dead serial killer who was blamed for murdering at least 18 people &#8211; Paul John Knowles.</strong>

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said agents were _&#8220;reasonably confident&#8221;_ that Ima Jean Sanders was killed 37 years ago by Paul John Knowles.

In 1974, Knowles, 28, of Orlando, went on a killing spree across several states, killing at least 18 people, including a Milledgeville man and his teenage daughter. Carwell Carr, 45, was stabbed with a pair of scissors, while his daughter, Mandy was strangled in their home.Knowles was captured in a roadblock near McDonough on I-75 north of Macon in November 1974 after kidnapping a Florida state trooper and another man near Perry, Fla., and later killing them in Pulaski County. Knowles was shot to death by a GBI agent on Dec. 18, 1974, while attempting to escape from custody near Douglasville.

Ima Jean was living with her mother and her 4-year-old sister in Warner Robins, Ga., when she disappeared in August 1974. Her sister remembers getting upset when Ima Jean told her to stay at home while she hopped in a van with some friends. She never saw her family again. In January 2011, DNA samples from Sanders’ mother and sister, now living in Texas, were sent to a national DNA database containing DNA of convicted criminals and missing persons. The genetic data from Sanders’ mother and sister matched DNA from the girl&#8217;s skeletal remains. Using this information, investigators developed evidence to support the likelihood that Sanders was killed in 1974 by Knowles.

Investigators say a key piece of evidence in the case was a letter written in 1975 to the GBI by a former U.S. attorney, which summarized Knowles&#8217; taped confessions to crimes.&#8221;

> Sometime in August 1974, Knowles picked up a white, female hitchhiker named Alma who represented her age as 13 or 14 but who appeared to be in her late teens,&#8221; the letter states. &#8220;He carried this girl to a wooded area some distance from Macon, possibly west. He raped her and then strangled her and left her body in woods between trees.&#8221;

This week, the GBI medical examiner confirmed a DNA match, concluding that the skeletal remains belong to the girl. Warner Robins police Capt. Chris Rooks said the child&#8217;s remains are being released to the family so they can finally bury her.
