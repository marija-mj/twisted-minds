  <strong>Detectives investigating the alleged murder of three vice girls by “Crossbow Cannibal” Stephen Griffiths last night confirmed they are probing possible links with the unsolved murders of two more prostitutes. Stephen Griffiths, 40, has been charged with killing three women who vanished over the past 11 months.</strong>

Now detectives fear the crimes could be linked to the murders of Michaela Hague, 25, and 19-year-old Dawn Shields, who vanished from Sheffield’s vice zone 50 miles away. Street walkers befriended by Griffiths as they plied their trade near his flat have told detectives he was a regular visitor to red-light districts in South Yorkshire. He even offered to accompany one prostitute to other towns where he told her she could make extra cash because there were more men there. The 35-year-old said she was stunned when Griffiths – who was doing a Bradford University PhD on serial killers – appeared in court on Friday, introducing himself as “the Crossbow Cannibal”.

_&#8220;I can’t believe he’s the same man who was like a brother to me for years. He fed me, washed my clothes and took me in when I was on the streets and had nowhere else to go. He never harmed me and even offered to protect me while I was out on the streets. He told me I’d do much better business if I went with him to Sheffield, Barnsley and Doncaster. He said he went regularly to red-light districts there and there was more cash to be made than in Bradford.&#8221;_

Griffiths was arrested last Monday after a caretaker in the block of flats where he lived in Bradford discovered shocking CCTV footage of Suzanne Blamires being beaten by a man who then fired a crossbow into her skull. Her dismembered body has since been recovered from the River Aire four miles away in Shipley. Police are also probing claims that part of her body may have been eaten by her killer. They are still searching for the remains of the other two women.

While searching the perimeter detectives have also found a “Ripper kit” of knives and hacksaws stashed inside a bag and dumped in a river. Inside were the razor sharp blades which may have been used to dismember the street-walker victims. Human tissue may also be inside but police are waiting for the bag to dry to avoid damaging DNA evidence before opening it. It was pulled from the Aire in Shipley, West Yorks – four-miles from self-proclaimed Crossbow Cannibal Stephen Griffiths’ flat.

Griffiths is on suicide watch in a single cell in a health care unit in the &#8220;Mansion&#8221;, a top-security Wakefield, West Yorks, which houses some of Britain&#8217;s most notorious serial killers and sex offenders. &#8220;Crossbow Cannibal&#8221; Stephen Griffiths said he had a vision that he would be locked up in the jail dubbed &#8220;Monster Mansion&#8221;. A prison insider revealed: _&#8220;He said he used to look up at the high walls and bars over the windows and think what it would be like to be inside. Griffiths said the last time he walked around the jail was about three weeks before he was arrested. He said he had a sort of vision that he would be locked up in Wakefield very soon.&#8221;_
