  <strong>A new photo of young Peter Tobin resurfaced and presents the latest clue police are hoping will unravel the past of one of Britain&#8217;s most notorious serial killers.</strong>

<img src="img/post/YoungPeterTobin.jpg" alt="photo of young serial killer Peter Tobin" title="young Peter Tobin" class="left" /> On the photo on the left, you can see a sex murderer Peter Tobin as a man of 27, who is now serving a life sentence for the murder of 23-year-old Polish student Angelika Kluk and is linked to unresolved disappearances of several other young women in Sussex. Police are hoping the image will jog people&#8217;s memories if they knew Tobin as a young man and give officers a clearer view of his past.

There are fears that he may have killed many more and could have been carrying out gruesome sexual attacks in the county undetected throughout the seventies and eighties. Among those suspected of being Tobin&#8217;s victims is student Jessie Earl who disappeared from her Eastbourne bedsit in 1980 and whose remains were found at Beachy Head nine years later. Police are also listing Louise Kay, who was last seen in 1988 dropping a friend home from an Eastbourne club, as a potential Tobin victim.  
Police have been gathering information about Tobin&#8217;s life in Brighton and Hove since three people came forward saying they knew about his time in the city. Tobin is thought to have been a member of a Biker Gang called the Rising Sun and officers are hoping to trace members of that group as well as a woman possibly called Lesley who lived at a seafront hotel in the city in 1986 and whose parents are believed to have attempted to legally prevent her from seeing Tobin.

They are also trying to trace items of women&#8217;s jewelry that Tobin owned which could help identify more victims and reveal the full extent of the vile acts of one of Britain&#8217;s most evil men.
