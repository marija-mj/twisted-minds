  <strong>Serial killer Peter Tobin is being investigated for his suspected part in a pedophile ring that abused children during the 1980s and 1990. A car driver (a witness who tipped police off) claims Tobin and at least two others carried out the attacks in Portsmouth.The inquiry is part of a wider probe into Tobin, 63, who has been convicted of the murder of three young women.</strong>

A police source said: &#8220;Along with Tobin, we have been given the names of two other members of this alleged pedophile ring. _&#8220;The investigation is in the early stages but we are working quickly to establish whether the other members are still alive. Also whether they have convictions, did they know Tobin and if so, what can they tell us about him. We already know he raped and killed teenage girls as well as a young woman &#8211; but do we need to broaden our investigation to take in even younger victims?&#8221;_

[Peter Tobin](http://twistedminds.creativescapism.com/cold-cases/peter-tobin-may-have-been-a-serial-killer/ "read more about Peter Tobin's case"), 61, was convicted in 2007 and is already serving life for three murders &#8211; Polish student Angelika Kluk, 23; Vicky Hamilton, 15; and Dinah McNicol, 18.

Police may make a fresh search of his former homes as part of their continuing probe. The source added: _&#8220;Our task has been to find out as much about Tobin as possible. We established a timeline to see where he lived, worked, and who he mixed with. We still have a couple of major gaps, but these are being filled in all the time as new bits of information come in.&#8221;_

In particular Tobin is now being linked to the disappearance of Louise Kay, 18, who went missing after a night out in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in June 1988. After jewelry found in Tobin&#8217;s belongings had not been claimed by his former wives, police strongly believe that they may be trophies he collected from other victims.
