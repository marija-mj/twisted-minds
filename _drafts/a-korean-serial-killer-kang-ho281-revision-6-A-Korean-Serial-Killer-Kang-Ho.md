This saying can be used no better to describe a serial killer Kang Ho, whom his neighbors and co-workers described as kind and faithful. He was also good-looking and affable. His smiling face, appearing in some newspapers, is enough to belie the brutal nature of his crime. The suspect was apparently dexterous in hiding his true identity behind his docile appearance.

His first homicide allegedly took place Dec. 13, 2006, when he strangled a 45-year-old karaoke bar employee to death after the two had sex. He killed four other women by Jan. 7, 2007. Twenty-two months later, Kang reportedly killed a 48-year housewife in Suwon on November 19, 2008 and a 20-year-old student in Gunpo a month later.

Investigators found four bodies on Friday and sent them to the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for DNA analysis, said Na Won-ho, another police official involved with the case. Another body was found last year. Investigators have not found the body of one victim. Kang said he buried it in an area that has undergone terrain changes since a golf training facility was built there, Na said.

Kang is also suspected in the 2005 arson deaths of his fourth wife and her mother (which he denied), police said in a statement. Police also said he told investigators he felt &#8220;helpless&#8221; after his wife&#8217;s death and developed the urge to kill about a year later.

Investigators, crime experts and the public are wondering what motivated Kang to go on a killing spree. Criminal psychologists point out that Kang might be a typical psychopath, lacking feelings of compunction and guilt. He told police he approached his victims for sex — or with the intent to rape them — and then strangled them with a pair of stockings, Park said at a briefing Friday. He said he then buried their bodies. _&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t suppress my urges after committing the first murder,&#8221;_ investigators quoted Kang as saying.
