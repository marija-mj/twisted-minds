Authorities in New York have resumed the search for additional bodies and clues in the Long Island serial killer investigation. According to Suffolk County police, the latest search has been prompted by aerial imaging that was previously conducted by the FBI, but their sweep of 11 hot spots in aerial photographs came up dry.

Police suspect the bodies they have found are the work of more than one killer. The first four bodies, found in December 2010 and wrapped in burlap, were identified by police as Craigslist escorts. The victims were later identified as Megan Waterman, 22, of Long Island, N.Y.; Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Conn.; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Buffalo, N.Y.; and Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of Wilmington, N.Y.

Police subsequently recovered the remains of six others. A female toddler, an Asian male and two unidentified victims were found, as well as the partially dismembered remains of two other women, one of whom has been identified as 20-year-old Jessica Taylor, of Washington, D.C., whom police identified as a prostitute. Her torso was found in 2003 but her head, hands and forearm were found by police almost 30 miles away earlier this year. The sexes and identities of the unidentified victims are not yet known.

Investigators believe the first four victims are connected to the same serial killer. The others, they suspect, are the victims of more than one killer who coincidentally used the same dumping grounds. Some believe the killings are work of a cop, or two cops. The NYPD however denies the police is involved, and there are no suspects in this case.
