    <h4>
      Serial Killers &#8211; Jeffrey Dahmer&#8217;s Trial
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Inside his apartment, the drawers of the bedroom highboy were crammed with Polaroids of body parts and mutilated corpses -including one shot of a torso eaten away from the nipples down by acid. That was just the beginning of the nightmare. Inside a freezer, police found three human heads plus an assortment of organs: intestines, lungs, livers, kidneys, and a heart. Dahmer told the police that he was saving the heart to &#8220;eat later.&#8221;

      Another head was stored in the refrigerator next to an open box of baking soda. Seven skulls and five complete skeletons were stashed in various places around the apartment, along with miscellaneous remains: bone fragments, decomposed hands, sexual organs in a lobster pot. The police also found bottles of acid, chloroform, and formaldehyde, and three electric saws. Altogether, these ghastly trophies represented the remains of eleven victims. Dahmer would later confess to seventeen murders in all.

      By August 22, 1991, Dahmer had been charged with 15 counts of murder. At his trial, beginning on January 30, 1992, Dahmer filed a plea of guilty but insane. Two weeks later, on February 15, jurors found him sane and responsible for his actions. The court imposed 15 consecutive life sentences, thus requiring Dahmer to serve a minimum of 936 years. During his own final statement, Dahmer expressed a desire to die.

      In prison, Dahmer refused offers of protective custody despite the many threats against his life. On July 3, 1994, another convict tried to slash his throat in the prison chapel, but Dahmer emerged from the incident with only minor scratches and refused to press charges. Five months later, on November 28, he was cleaning a bathroom adjacent to the prison gym when another member of the work detail, 25-year-old Christopher Scarver, grabbed an iron bar from a nearby exercise machine and smashed Dahmer&#8217;s skull, killing him instantly.
