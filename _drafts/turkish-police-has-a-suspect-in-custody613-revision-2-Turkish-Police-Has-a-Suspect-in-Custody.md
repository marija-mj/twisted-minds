(27) in Mu?la&#8217;s Bodrum district in the early morning hours on Wednesday following an intensive effort that involved 350 police officers from ?zmir as well as cooperation from law enforcement and judicial authorities in Mu?la. Police tracked the suspect through victim Mustafa Has&#8217; mobile phone, which H.A. allegedly sold to a shop in Mu?la, said ?zmir Gov. Cahit K?raç. No witnesses have come forward in the killings, and security camera records have not yielded any clear footage. A sketch of the suspect was released by police Tuesday, but ?zmir Police Chief Ercüment Y?lmaz said the sketch, which bore no resemblance to the suspect, was released purposefully to allow him to move without concern that police were tracking him. K?raç said H.A. did not have a criminal record.

Ayr? was apprehended by police at around 5:30 a.m. yesterday and sent for legal processing. Along with Ayr?, police seized the bags of the three victims and the remaining cell phones, K?raç said. News reports yesterday said in addition Ayr? had been in possession of a passport and 4,000 euros. The suspect also said he had stolen the gun he allegedly used in the murders from a restaurant in Bodrum. Ayr? gave his initial testimony to authorities in ?zmir yesterday and confessed to the murders. He said that he killed his victims for money.

Police Chief Y?lmaz explained the working groups his department had set up to draw connections between the crime scene and the criminal &#8212; and to make the killer easier to catch. Explaining that officers gathered video evidence from security cameras in the areas near the murder, Y?lmaz noted that Ayr? had gone to a store to sell one of the victims’ cell phones, allowing police access to that footage as well. Police tracked the killer as he boarded a bus from ?zmir to Bodrum.
