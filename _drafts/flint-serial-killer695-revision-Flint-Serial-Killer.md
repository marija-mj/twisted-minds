<img src="img/post/FlintSerialKiller.jpg" alt="Flint serial killer responsible for stabbing The sketch of a white man wearing a baseball cap, with a mustache and goatee, is shown with a stud through the top of his left ear. The drawing is dated from Wednesday. He had earlier been described as being a muscular, light-haired man, between 5-foot-11 and 6-foot-2. Today, Michigan State Police, leading a task force, added that the man weighs between 180 to 210 pounds and is in his late 20s to early 30s. Survivors have told police their attacker approached them with a story about needing help. Some said they were stabbed multiple times without warning. _&#8220;He&#8217;s killed five people,&#8221;_ Flint Police Sgt. J. Leigh Golden said Thursday. _&#8220;He&#8217;s just killing them, not robbing them.&#8221;_ Investigators said that since May, the serial killer has been targeting vulnerable, small-framed African-American men. Two of the men he stabbed had special needs, police said. _&#8220;To me, he&#8217;s a bully. He&#8217;s picking on people smaller than him or somewhat vulnerable. He doesn&#8217;t give a warning; he doesn’t rob them. He gives them no reason at all,&#8221;_ said Flint police Lt. Tim Johnson during a news conference Thursday.

Most of the stabbings have occurred late at night or early in the morning near major roadways in Flint and Flint Township, where authorities said it is easier for the killer to stalk people and flee quickly. The last victim, a 26-year-old male, told the task force investigators that he had been stabbed by a suspect matching the serial killer&#8217;s description at about 3 a.m. July 27. The victim told police he was walking on Pierson Road near Fleming Road when the suspect approached him and stabbed him repeatedly. The suspect asked him for help with his vehicle before the attack. The victim told police the vehicle description was similar to the description released by police Monday — a Blazer-type vehicle, dark green over tan.

Authorities are working with a forensic psychologist to determine whether the stabbings are racially motivated hate crimes. Police say no other developments have occurred in the case since Monday evening. Anyone with information is asked to call the Flint Police Department or the Michigan State Police at 866-246-9500.
