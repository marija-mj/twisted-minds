  <strong>Britain&#8217;s top serial killer expert, Professor David Wilson, reveals the explosive evidence which has convinced him that serial killer Peter Tobin is dance hall fiend Bible John. He has been investigating Tobin for more than three years and says he would stake his credibility on Tobin being the notorious killer.</strong>

In exclusive extracts from his new book _The Lost British Serial Killer_, Wilson reveals why he believes Tobin committed the three brutal, unsolved murders in Glasgow that have been blamed on Bible John. And he describes the bombshell courtroom moment when he became certain that Tobin was guilty of the murders.

Wilson, professor of criminology at the Centre for Criminal Justice Policy and Research at Birmingham University, became convinced he was looking at Bible John during Tobin&#8217;s trial for the 1991 murder of teenager Dinah McNicol. Hitch-hiker David Tremlett was a reluctant witness, as police initially suspected he had murdered Dinah.

_&#8220;He shared a hitched lift from Liphook Music Festival in Hampshire with her. She was sitting in the front of Tobin&#8217;s cab while he was in the back and he overheard a conversation where Tobin said to Dinah that the Cambridge Folk Festival was &#8216;more my style&#8217;. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing. He was trying to imply he was socially superior and that he could be trusted. This was the exactly the same type of conversation that witness Jeannie Williams had in the back of a Glasgow taxi all those years ago with Bible John. Jeannie recalled how the killer seemed to want to make out he was a cut above everyone else. He talked about how he didn&#8217;t support Celtic or Rangers, which was highly unusual in Glasgow, and how he didn&#8217;t drink at Hogmanay. He talked about his cousin&#8217;s hole-in-one at golf and it was exactly the same technique he was using._

_&#8220;Tobin kept his head down and rarely made eye contact throughout the trial but he looked up at this statement and I thought, &#8216;You are looking up because you know the significance of that&#8217;. I looked around the court but no one else had picked up on it. Despite the decades between the conversations, the link, to me, was clear and I wanted to stand up and shout, &#8216;Peter Tobin is Bible John!'&#8221;_ 

During his research for the book, Wilson visited the sites of the Bible John murders and interviewed witnesses and former detectives. The murders stopped when Tobin left Glasgow. His travels around Britain, raping and possibly murdering other women, could explain why the killings came to a sudden halt in 1969 after three deaths in less than two years.

Wilson first became interested in Tobin when he was convicted of murdering Angelika. The evil handyman hid her body under the floorboards of St Patrick &#8216;s Church in Anderston, Glasgow. Wilson said:_ _&#8220;I was fascinated that a man in his sixties was capable of such a violent crime. I tracked down his first wife Margaret Mackintosh. Bible John was a sexual sadist and we have testimony from Margaret of Tobin&#8217;s sexual sadism. Jeannie gave a surname for John and she thought it was something like &#8216;Sempleson&#8217; or &#8216;Templeton&#8217;. Tobin used the name John Semple. That is a striking piece of evidence that cannot be coincidental.&#8221;__

The criminologist accepts there may never be definitive proof that Tobin is the infamous serial killer but he added_: _&#8220;I am as convinced as it&#8217;s able to be. As far as I am concerned the case is closed.&#8221;__

Tobin, 63, will die in jail, having been convicted of murdering Scots schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton, Essex teenager Dinah and Polish student Angelika Kluk in Glasgow. He has since been linked with as many as 48 victims &#8211; and a special police operation has been set up to probe links between Tobin and a string of unsolved murders. We might never know the truth!
