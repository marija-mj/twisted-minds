  <strong>Memoirs of a Serial Killer</strong> by Daniel Brian, is a book about ‘Romeo,’ the Valentine Serial Killer, a fictional character made out of numerous real-life interviews, court transcripts and eye witness accounts. This thrilling book gives an unflinching look into the mind of one of the most vicious serial killers in American history. &#8216;Romeo&#8217; was ritually abused by his parents as a child and the book allows the reader to accompany him on his quest to kill as many women as possible – women that remind him of his mother.

> Memoirs of a Serial Killer is a drop dead frontal assault that provokes, rather than patronizes its reader, and is truly the most dangerous kind of true crime genre book in existence, pulling no punches and telling no lies – and narrated by one of the most dangerous men in existence; Romeo could be your next door neighbor, the guy that could be your best friend, but who secretly slaughters women with about as much remorse as Jack the Ripper, robbing, raping, burning and killing, attacking America more like an epidemic plague than a human being.
