  <strong>Larry Murphy, a suspected Irish serial killer is due to be freed in August this year, authorities have confirmed. Murphy is one of Ireland&#8217;s most notorious criminals and he is a suspect for the disappearance of some of the six women missing in Leinster in the 1990s.</strong>

One of the Larry&#8217;s victims is believed to be an American Irish woman, 26-year-old Annie McCarrick, from New York who returned to Ireland in 1993 after attending college there and falling in love with the place. The last thing anyone knows for sure about her is that on the morning she disappeared, she&#8217;d run errands at the local bank and grocery store. What happened after that is a mystery. One witness says she saw Annie later that day on a No. 44 city bus. The bus route ends in the pretty Irish small town of Enniskerry in nearby Wicklow where Annie often visited. 

Murphy was eventually convicted of the rape of a Carlow businesswoman who he took to the Wicklow Mountains, but she was saved when men out hunting came across him assaulting her. 

Murphy is a suspect for the disappearance of some of the six women missing in Leinster in the 1990s. Police investigated him in the disappearance of Jo Jo Dullard, Deirdre Jacob and Annie McCarrick in the 1990s. Missing woman Jo Jo Dullard was last seen in Moone, Co Kildare, just 13 miles from Humewood Castle. The other victims were also in the area.

Larry Murphy&#8217;s ten-year sentence is now up, just as police are investigating what may be a hidden grave just two miles from his old home. Police confirmed they conducted an examination of the open plot last month and removed earth fragments for analysis. One of the men that made the new grim discovery told the Evening Herald how the hole looked remarkably like a grave: _&#8220;My friend and I were shooting in the wooded area just outside the grounds of Humewood Castle when we discovered this strange hole,_&#8221; he said. _&#8220;It was dug out like a grave. It was six feet long, two and a half feet wide and three feet deep. It looked like it was dug a number of years ago, there was moss growing in it. It is in a pretty open area and can be seen from the road.&#8221;_

Murphy refused to cooperate with the police, and seeing how there is no evidence to prosecute him or even confirm there is a serial killer, the case files remains open, and Larry is getting freed.
