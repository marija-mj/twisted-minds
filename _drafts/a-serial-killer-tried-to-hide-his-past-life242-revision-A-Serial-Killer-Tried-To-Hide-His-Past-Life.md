  <strong>Archie &#8220;Mad Dog&#8221; McCafferty, a serial killer served 23 years in prison for the murder of three people in Australia and was living in Edinburgh under a new identity, by the name James Lok. The 58-year-old&#8217;s past was only revealed when he was caught driving a stolen car and his original name was given in court.</strong>

<img class="left" src="/img/post/Archibald.jpg" alt="Archibald McCafferty" /> McCafferty emigrated to Australia with his family when he was ten years old. He was constantly in trouble with the police. By the time he was 12 was placed in an institution for stealing, he already had a long record. By the time he was 18 Archie had been in institutions five times and had been classed as an incorrigible juvenile delinquent. He fell in love and married Janice Redington, but only their marriage lasted only six week when she caught him sleeping with another woman. Jenice wasn&#8217;t impressed, but Archie&#8217;s response was so violent it prompted his first visit to a psychiatric hospital.

He was jailed in 1974 for murdering three tramps in a five-day killing spree, sparked by the death of his six-week-old baby son. The baby&#8217;s death was an accident caused by his mother falling asleep and rolling over on top of the infant. That incident seemed to change him forever. At his trial, McCafferty said he heard the voice of his dead son telling him that if he killed seven people the boy would be brought back to life. After killing a few inmates he got a nickname &#8220;Australia&#8217;s Charles Manson&#8221;, but soon after he was deported back to Scotland.

McCafferty, who now uses the name James Lok, has been living in Beaverbank Place in Broughton while working as a self-employed painter. He said the only reason he changed his name was because he wanted a &#8216;quiet life&#8221; and his neighbors seemed to know nothing about his past identity.

Speaking following yesterday&#8217;s court appearance, McCafferty said that he was &#8220;not a criminal&#8221;, with his latest offence involving a &#8220;car, not mass murder&#8221;. He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m just a normal guy trying to get on with my life. My crimes were 35 years ago.&#8221;

Sheriff Charles Stoddart said: &#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied on the basis of the social inquiry report and what has been said on your behalf that I can deal with this with an alternative to custody.&#8221;
