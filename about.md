  Even though I am having a hard time of admitting it, I have started working on this website out of complete boredom. Serial Killers and psychological disorders were something that always interested me though, in an unusual way I must add, triggering some unknown and indescribable feelings which then led me into searching for more and more information on this particular subject. Nevertheless, I have to say that looking for all these articles online was the most interesting journey throughout the World Wide Web I have ever experienced.

I don&#8217;t know what is it that makes us enjoy exploring those twisted minds, of, make believe, normal people. It might be a strong compulsion driving our interest towards deviant human behavior in general, that authentic awe, and fear of realization that we all have it in us &#8211; scary dark side, waiting to be released.

I came up with this design and three column layout one night during my usual playing around with photoshop. I wanted to make the navigation rather simple. Heading is made up of different pictures, which I didn&#8217;t take but thanks to lovely uploaders on [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com "deviant art, lovely photos and amazing stock photography") I could use! Of curse I gave proper [credits](/about/credits/ "credits o every snigle resource I used"). On top of the page, with each page load, you can read a random quote by a serial killer. I included only the most shocking ones&#8230;

#### A Little Bit of Info About My Little Self

I&#8217;m not sure if anyone really cares to read this boring stuff but I ought to write a small biography.

I am a 21 years old urban planning student from Serbia. I am currently staying in Belgrade, in a student dorm called Karaburma, which I, by the way, absolutely love. I am an (un)usual girl with (un)usual interests. I love web design and photography, as well as writing, and I spend most of my time working on my laptop &#8211; it&#8217;s the best stress reliever ever! When I am not playing a geek, I like to take a walk, read a book, watch a movie, enjoy good old rock music, or spend some quality time with my friends.

I love to analyze everything about this world &#8211; especially the people in it. Thus my everlasting love for psychology, human behavior and the darker corners of our minds that every one of us might not have discovered yet.

And&#8230;No, I did not have a rough childhood, my parents were quite normal, and no, I have never ever met a serial killer, and I doubt I&#8217;d want to, and no, I have no real connections with this twisted world of murder and psychological disorders&#8230; But, yes, I did see a lot of movies on this subject, so one can say that was what made me interested in all this at the first place. Oh, that, and the fact that my mom works as a psychologist&#8230; so it&#8217;s kind of in my genes!
